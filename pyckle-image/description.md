Alice and Bob recently got into webdev. To test out their new skills they decided to make their very own blog website. They decided to blog about pickles since they both have an incredible passion for pickles.

After a lot of work they managed to build a pretty decent blog website, however it seems to me that they missed the chapter on security and have gotten themselves into quite the pickle!
